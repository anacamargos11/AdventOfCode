# AdventOfCode
This repository contains my solutions to selected problems from <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">the Advent of Code 2019</a>.

The folder for each day contains (for both part 1 and part 2):
<ul>
    <li> The solution code </li>
    <li> The input file </li>
    <li> The output file </li>
</ul>

Along with a README file with the task instructions.
